## üöÄ Key Features

| ‚öôÔ∏è Feature | üí° Why You'll Love It |
|------------|------------------------|
| üì¶ **File Chunking** | Files split into 1MB pieces for distributed storage. |
| üåê **Distributed Architecture** | Multi-node storage ensures high availability and redundancy. |
| üîÑ **Load Balancing** | Automatic traffic distribution across storage nodes. |
| üõ°Ô∏è **Fault Tolerance** | System survives node failures with redundant storage. |
| üìä **Real-time Monitoring** | Web dashboard shows system health and node status. |

## üöÄ How to Run SDFBS

### Prerequisites:
- üêç **Python 3.7+** installed
- üîß **Git** installed
- üßëüíª **VS Code** (recommended)

### Setup:
1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dhruvi-tech/Secure-Distributed-File-Backup-System.git
cd Secure-Distributed-File-Backup-System
```

2. **Navigate to the project:**
```
cd phase1-core-infrastructure
```

3. **Install Flask:**
```
pip install flask
```

### Choose and Run a Mode:

**üêç Simple Mode (Development):**
```
python simple_distributed.py
```
*Features: Basic file chunking, single-node simulation, web interface*

**üåê Complete Distributed (Multi-Node):**
```
python complete_distributed.py
```
*Features: P2P network, heartbeat tracking, dynamic scaling, master-slave architecture*

**üõ°Ô∏è With Redundancy (Recommended):**
```
python redundant_distributed.py
```
*Features: Cassandra database, master-slave replication, 2x redundancy, complete Phase 1 implementation*

### Access the System:
- Open browser to: **http://localhost:8080**
- Upload files and watch them distribute across nodes
- Monitor system health and redundancy

### Quick Commands:
- Check Python: `python --version`
- Check health: `curl http://localhost:8080/health`

**That's it! The distributed file backup system will be running with web interface, file chunking, and distributed storage.**

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ System Verification

1. Server starts without errors
2. Web interface loads at localhost:8080
3. File upload creates chunks distributed across nodes
4. Download reassembles chunks correctly
5. System shows redundancy and fault tolerance
6. Health endpoint returns system status

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Access Your Application

**Main Interface:** [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

- Upload files with automatic chunking
- View distributed storage across nodes
- Monitor system health and redundancy
- Download files with integrity verification
